# SSMsOnPlane

This repository shares vectorised python scripts to calculate various [surrogate safety measures (SSMs), or in another way called, surrogate measures of safety (SMoS)](https://www.ictct.net/wp-content/uploads/SMoS_Library/LIB_Tarko_2018.pdf) for pairs of road users on an abstracted plane of road, i.e., in a two-dimensional space. 

Two branches of SSMs are considered: 
- __Longitudinal SSMs__ that are originally designed for one-dimensional (rear-end) conflicts and collisions, but can be extended to two-dimensional space by assuming constant velocities. These include Time-To-Collision (TTC) [^1], Deceleration Rate to Avoid Collision (DRAC) [^2], Modified Time-To-Collision (MTTC) [^3], and Proportion of Stopping Distance (PSD) [^4] in this repository. A previous repo [Two-Dimensional-Time-To-Collision](https://github.com/Yiru-Jiao/Two-Dimensional-Time-To-Collision) is referred to for more details on the vectorised extention.
- __Two-Dimensional SSMs__ that are specifically designed for conflicts and collisions involving both longitudinal and lateral movements. These include Time Advantage (TAdv) [^5], Anticipated Collision Time (ACT) [^6], and Two-Dimensional Time-To-Collision (TTC2D) [^7] in this repository. In addition to the above, a recently proposed indicator, Emergency Index (EI) [^8], is open-sourced by its authors in the linked [repo](https://github.com/AutoChengh/EmergencyIndex).

These metrics/indicators are designed to be used with trajectory data from road users, such as vehicles or cyclists, to assess their interaction safety in a given scenario. For references to these indicators, please scroll down to the bottom of this page. 

Thanks to vectorisation, the implementations in this repository are very efficient in time for large-scale calculation. Helper functions to evaluate the efficiency are therefore also provided.

## Overview
The repository is structured as follows:
- **src/**  contains the main Python modules implementing the functions:
  - [`geometry_utils.py`](src/geometry_utils.py) provides geometric helper functions (e.g., `intersect`, `getpoints`, etc.) used to compute distances, intersections, and angles.
  - [`longitudinal_ssms.py`](src/longitudinal_ssms.py) implements longitudinal safety measures including TTC, DRAC, MTTC, and PSD.
  - [`two_dimensional_ssms.py`](src/two_dimensional_ssms.py) provides functions for two-dimensional safety measures including TAdv, TTC2D, and ACT.
  - [`efficiency_utils.py`](src/efficiency_utils.py) contains helper functions to evaluate the computational efficiency of the indicators by timing their execution on sample data.
- **assets/** contains supplementary files such as around 10,000 example data samples which are extrated from the lane-changes in the [highD](https://www.highd-dataset.com/) dataset, and a plot comparing the efficiency of indicators.

For more details on each function and its underlying logic, see the inline documentation in the source code. 

## Efficiency evaluation
The notebook `example.ipynb` provides a full demonstration of the efficiency evaluation functions. With a range of 1e4, 1e5, and 1e6 pairs of vehicles, below is a comparison plot showing the execution time of each indicator, tested over 20 runs.

## Package requirements
Any versions of the following packages should work: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` (for plotting in the notebook), and `tqdm` (for progress visualization in the notebook).

## Usage
To compute a safety measure, import the corresponding function and pass in a `pandas` dataframe with the required variables.

For instance, to compute the Time-To-Collision (TTC):

```python
import pandas as pd
from src.longitudinal_ssms import TTC

# Create or load your samples
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

results = TTC(df, toreturn='dataframe')
print(results[['TTC']].head())
```

## Notes
- The two road users under evaluation are considered to never collide if they keep current speed when 
    - indicator value is np.inf if the used indicator is TTC, MTTC, TTC2D, TAdv, or ACT;
    - indicator value is 0 if the used indicator is DRAC.

- When the indicator value is smaller than 0, the bounding boxes of the two road users are overlapping. This is due to approximating the space occupied by an object with a rectangular. In other words, negative indicator in this computation means a collision almost (or although seldom, already) occurred.

- The computation can return extreme small positive values (for TTC/MTTC) or extreme large values (for DRAC) even when the vehivles overlap a bit (so should be negative values). In order to improve the accuracy, please use the function `geometry_utils.CurrentD(samples)` to exclude overlapping objects.
